Bob owns a car dealership in Framingham, Massachusetts, "Bob's Acme of Framingham". Bob sells new cars manufactured by Acme as well as used cars acquired from buyer trade-ins and auction. 

Alice needs a new car. She currently owns, properly titled and clear of liens, a 1999 Acme Jalopy. She wants a 2016 Acme Flash and has test driven them at several dealers. Alice visited Bob's website and found a large inventory Acme Flashes that she liked. 

Alice completed a credit applicaton through Bob's website. She received an email response shortly thereafter notifying that she had been approved for financing a Flash for up to 72 months at an intereest rate of 5.5% from one of the dealer's financing sources, a regional credit union, Charlie's Credit Union. 

On January 15, 2016, Alice drove her Jalopy to Bob's to buy a Flash. Bob's salesperson took her on a test drive of two Flashes.  While she was test driving, Bob's technicians evaluated the Jalopy for trade-in, giving it a value of $2,900.

Alice chose a 4-cylinder red Flash with a price of $32,000. She negotiated a price of $31,000, plus credit for her trade-in.

Bob presented Alice with a Retail Installment Contract for the purchase of the vehicle. The deal included the following terms: Purchase price, trade value, interest rate, 60 payment of $567.30 commencing on February 1, 2016.

Alice signed the contract electronically. Bob explained that the dealership was using a new system for creating and storing contracts electronically. Bob printed and gave her a paper copy of the deal. Alice drove the car away and made her first payment in February. She made no more payments after February.

In March, Charlie's collection agent tried to reach Alice by phone, but her number was disconnected. Charlie referred Alice's account to a repossession agent, Frank's Towing and Recovery service. Frank repossessed the vehicle peaceably at Alice's workplace on April 1, 2016.

On April 1, 2016, Charlie accelerated the balance due on the loan, for a total of $34,148.27 (accelerated balance plus late fee) Charlie sent a notice of repossession and right to redeem the vehicle upon payment of the accelerated balance. Alice did not respond.

The vehicle was sold at a large wholesale auction on May 15, 2016, for $22,550, and the proceeds remitted to Charlie. Auction costs were $250. Repossession fees were $300. 

On June 1, 2016 Charlie sent a notice of deficiency to Alice demanding payment on the outstanding deficiency balance of $11,148.27.   Alice did not respond to the letter. 

Charlie referred Alice's file to Dewey, Charlie's lawyer. Dewey sent Alice a demand letter on July 1, 2016, containing all required consumer notices. Alice did not respond. Dewey filed a civil complaint against Alice on August 15, 2016, attaching the contract and a copy of the payment history to the complaint, along with an affidavit signed by Charlie's collection manager.  Alice hired a lawyer, Ellen, who answered the complaint on Alice's behalf. 

Alice's answer to the complaint denied the authenticity of the contract, denied that the electronic signature was hers. Alice moved to strike the contract and payment history as inadmissible hearsay.

[As a Socratic counter-factual, we should throw in a "what if" or two, just to keep the right angle engineers denialists of any ambiguity tethered to reality of creative common law causes sounding in equity... perhaps with a revelation that the VIN encoded on the Blockchain tended to support the non-paying buyer claim that the [Jalopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decrepit_car#/media/File:Joshua_Tree_-_Love_car.jpg) was a lemon or the borrower signature on the loan was forged by the dealer.][Pulling some content from the commit extended description into the drafting note because there may be something useful in the musings, here: "This photo of a car that is a Jalopy but may not be the model/year expected is Creative Commons and made me chuckle: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decrepit_car#/media/File:Joshua_Tree_-_Love_car.jpg   Some "What If" thought experiements could be of value to fill out the major gaps in the main idea, so long as it does not risk confusing people. Perhaps after ensuring the intended conclusions are unmistakably unavoidable we could toss a "what if the facts were different in this one way" legal grenade.  Definitely not in the fashion of a "gotcha!" or "devil's advocate" blow hard lawyer but could a basic fraud factor be used show how sometimes the buyer is the problem and sometimes the seller is the problem and sometimes the lender is the problem and in all cases the Blockchain is flexible enough to be fit for purpose over time to avoid the traps all together.  If the car "as delivered" was a lemon or the dealer forged a signature we could, for instance, assert that the code could be configured to trigger an online mediator at a certain point who could ask some questions, get some evidence and quickly identify whether some crime, fraud or otherwise non-obvious hucksterism is in play."][for a 'gotcha' that is directly related to formation, what about <https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartIII/TitleIV/Chapter255B/Section13> a requirement for delivery of copy of contract at signing. We can have Alice deny that. As a second gotcha, I like something like infancy or incompetence as defense.]
