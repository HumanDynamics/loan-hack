TLDR:

Blockchain techology can enable integration of business, legal and technical aspects of transactions. To illustrate and prove this thesis, (Dazza and Nina) spent the week hacking a core legal element, the secured transaction.  In a secured transaction, collateral is pledged as security for a debt. The documentary elements of a secured transaction are typically general contract terms and conditions, a promissory note and a collateral security agreement,  These three elements serve different functions and are often, but not always, separate documents within a loan transaction. By iterating a methodical, modular implementation of secured loans, we can use blockchain technology to both replicate and advance legally significant commercial relationships.



Blockchain storage provides the building blocks for decentralized internet commerce. Smart contracts create the rails on which things created out of the blocks will move across networks. Blockchain-based smart contract ecosystems provide an interoperable, global solution for turning data into evidence upon which relationships may be built. In the legal context, this creates a secure way to originate electronic assets that meet statutory requirements of uniqueness and control of a record and further link the asset to smart contract securities and derivative products in a rock-solid audit trail. 

Topic Items: 

To illustrate blockchain smart contract potential, we explored consumer automobile loan originations. An automobile loan is a secured loan. A vehicle (collateral) is pledged as security for the borrower's promise to make payments. In a secured transaction, if the borrower fails to make payments, the creditor has the right to repossess and sell the collateral to satisfy the loan. The elements of a secured transaction are: (1) a promise to pay; (2) a security interest in identifiable collateral; and (3) perfection of the interest.  Perfection puts the world on notice of an interest. It is possible to securitize almost any kind of asset in which a security interested can be perfected, including electronic contracts. Blockchain technology is an excellent fit for a transparent method for establishing ownership and control of electronic contracts for purposes of securitization of collateral. 

In the U.S., secured transactions are generally covered by Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code ("U.C.C.""). Additionally, consumer auto loans are often regulated by states and federal statutes, for example (Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 255B, Retail Instalment Sales of Motor Vehicles.)<https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartIII/TitleIV/Chapter255B>. 


### Record Evidence on Blockchain of Enforceable Contract

Step one of a smart contract loan implementation involves storing a fully-integrated electronic contract in a blockchain vault. This seemingly small step is critical in preserving the contract for purposes of enforcement and use as an asset. Blockchain technology can create and preserve reliable *evidence*, critical to providing bedrock element of contract law: enforceability.

Legal enforcement of a contract means obtaining the assistance of a court in order to force the parties to comply with the promises they made. This certainty of judicial enforcement provides the predictability of outcome necessary to make a loan, i.e. to engage in the risk-bearing behavior of spending money to day in exchange for increased returns tomorrow. The foundation of enforceability is evidence, that is, the rubric under which we decide that a fact is reliable enough to be considered by a court. 

Blockchain smart contracts meet this standard via cryptographically secure content-addressable storage. In a process called hashing, data is passed through complex equations to produce a unique identifier. The hashing process is one-way, meaning no two sets of data produce the same outcome, and it is infeasible to decipher the hash to reveal the contents without a key. The distributed ledger provides the requisite immutability and audit trail.This combination produces the unique record of provenance, authority and control required by existing law, exceeding the capabilities of prior technology.

Blockchain storage of enforceable contracts provides the chain of custody and authentication required in order to admit a record into evidence. This step alone meets several manifest business needs. The evidence-recording aspect of contracting is today best accomplished by *dual integration*, the combination of an enforceable, integrated electronic contract with blockchain storage. 

Blockchain storage gives a more accurate view on admissibility of a contract, a critical step for enforceabilty. Rather than simply rely on a human sworn statement to provide authentication, blockchain storage provides a timestamp, attribution and a record of all events related to the document. Dual integration allows us to save a contract in a way that meets parties' existing commercial needs while building solutions that take advantage of more complex smart contract functionality.

Storage of a contract in a blockchain system alone is a significant improvement over legacy models of recording debt records. A blockchain electronic evidence vault allows income generation by hypothecation of new asset classes and savings by way of preservation of evidence. Blockchain evidence storage solves multiple problems in nonperforming loans. Adding smart contracts to the process allows us to act on reliable evidence and permission, i.e., execution of the contract's terms.


### Integrate Key Aspects of Legal Auto Loan Agreements with Technical Capabilities

Beyond providing a more sound record upon which courts and markets can rely, smart contracts open the door to self-enforcement of certain contractual provisions. Appropriate terms for smart contract are those that are managed solely by documentary conditions and non-discretionary decisions. 


*Promissory note*. A promissory note is an enforceable promise to pay money in the future, often written as "borrower promises to pay lender" some sum. Promissory notes are fungible and transfer rights and obligations, not currency. When incorporated into an installment contract like an auto loan, a promise to pay is the primary value item for the lender: it represents a future income stream and gives a contract independent value as an asset. Promises to pay are often sold and/or transformed into investment vehicles like derivatives. Smart contracts have the ability to record, control and transfer enforceable rights and obligations, including representing dematerialized promissory notes recorded solely in electronic form. 

Transferable smart contract promissory notes further have the ability to automatically direct an income stream. For example, a pool of smart contract promissory notes may be securitized and the payment rights automatically, transparently assigned for securities and derivatives.

*Security Agreement*. The other functional element of a secured transaction is a collateral security agreement, usually designated by the "magic words" *borrower grants creditor a security interest in collateral*. Collateral security agreements are well-suited to smart contract functionality and open the door to new kinds of financial models and processes using blockchain technology.  

Using blockchains in many kinds of secured transactions is foreseeable. The method of creating and maintaining an enforceable securiy interest is highly variable for different kinds of collateral and ind different jurisdictions. Collateral security agreements underscore the legal due diligence aspect of building commercial relationships.  

### Integrate Key Legal Processes with Technical Capabilities

*Perfecting ownership and security interests*. A critical element in secured transactions is perfection of the interest, that is, putting world on notice of a creditor's rights in the collateral. Perfection rules vary based on, among other things, collateral type. For an automobile loan, perfection of a security interest usually means making a filing with the state automobile registry, i.e. the Department of Motor Vehicles.

A smart contract application integration can update electronic registries that maintain chain of title. Security interests might be noted in new ways in a blockchain-enabled system. For example, a vehicle's title might be a smart contract that would register liens and changes of ownership. Similar rules may be applied to other assets symbolized by tokens, enabling new ways of establishing control of intangible assets for purpose of securitization rules. 

*Continuing compliance with contract and regulatory requirements.* Smart contracts can further automate compliance with many systems. In our automobile loan example, the buyer promises to maintain insurance on the vehicle and Massachusetts requires vehicle owners to maintain insurance. In the event of lapse, smart contracts can be programmed to automatically procure lender-placed insurance as well as notify the DMV.
